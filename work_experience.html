									<h3>Concussion Helmet Research Independent Study, Los Angeles, June 2018-2019</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img object-fit="contain" src="images/woodpecker.jpg" alt="yellow bellied sapsucker image" /></span>Studied animals that receive frequent head traumas like gannet birds, woodpeckers and rams to design a helmet that reduced the g-force of impacts in soccer through repeated prototyping and testing. I utilized an Arduino 200g accelerometer to deduce which prototypes were the most effective. I won 1st place in the Engineering Applications category at the Los Angeles County Science Fair for this project and kickstarted my experience in engineering. </p>

									<h3>RMS Energy Consulting, Environmental Engineering Technical Intern, Los Angeles, May 2019-December 2021 </h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img object-fit = "contain" src="images/rms.jpg" alt="RMS Energy Consulting logo" /></span> I worked on connecting academia and start-ups with Southern California utilities to test, implement and commercialize emerging energy and sustainable technology on a wide scale. I developed measurement and verification plans for a variety of in-field and lab projects. I applied to and successfully won a $4 million DOE Electrical Vehicle grant with Stanford's National Energy Lab. </p>

									<h3>Bioreactor Control System Research and Retrofit, Cornell University Department of Environmental and Civil Engineering and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, January 2022-May 2023</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img object-fit = "contain" src="images/cornell.png" alt="" /></span> I worked with a master's student to retrofit a woodchip bioreactor that increased nitrate removal by overcoming limitations to denitrifying microbial metabolisms while utilizing IoT technology and feedback control to optimize performance. I created a flexible blueprint for implementing IoT technology and real-time control methods in woodchip bioreactors to facilitate the uptake of these technological innovations among farmers. In addition, I calibrated, tested and maintained all of the digital, analog and SDI-12 sensors while retrofitting them to function with Arduino technology. </p>
