										<h2>My Engineering Experience Timeline</h2>
									</header>
									<div>								
									<h3>Concussion Helmet Research Independent Study, Los Angeles, June 2018-2019</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img object-fit="contain" src="images/woodpecker.jpg" width= "200" height = "200" alt="yellow bellied sapsucker image" /></span>Studied animals that receive frequent head traumas like gannet birds, woodpeckers and rams to design a helmet that reduced the g-force of impacts in soccer through repeated prototyping and testing. I utilized an Arduino 200g accelerometer to deduce which prototypes were the most effective. I won 1st place in the Engineering Applications category at the Los Angeles County Science Fair for this project and kickstarted my experience in engineering. </p>

									<h3>RMS Energy Consulting, Environmental Engineering Technical Intern, Los Angeles, May 2019-December 2021 </h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img object-fit = "contain" src="images/rms.jpg" width= "200" height = "200" alt="RMS Energy Consulting logo" /></span> I worked on connecting academia and start-ups with Southern California utilities to test, implement and commercialize emerging energy and sustainable technology on a wide scale. I developed measurement and verification plans for a variety of in-field and lab projects. I applied to and successfully won a $4 million DOE Electrical Vehicle grant with Stanford's National Energy Lab. </p>

									<h3>Bioreactor Control System Research and Retrofit, Cornell University Department of Environmental and Civil Engineering and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, January 2022-May 2023</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img object-fit = "contain" src="images/cornell.png" width= "200" height = "200" alt="" /></span> I worked with a master's student to retrofit a woodchip bioreactor that increased nitrate removal by overcoming limitations to denitrifying microbial metabolisms while utilizing IoT technology and feedback control to optimize performance. I created a flexible blueprint for implementing IoT technology and real-time control methods in woodchip bioreactors to facilitate the uptake of these technological innovations among farmers. In addition, I calibrated, tested and maintained all of the digital, analog and SDI-12 sensors while retrofitting them to function with Arduino technology. </p>

									<h3>Arcadis, Electrical Engineering Intern, June 2023-Present</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img object-fit = "contain" src="images/arcadis-logo.png" width= "200" height = "200" alt="" /></span> I currently am working with Arcadis as a technical intern. Arcadis is an environmental engineering consulting company that works on sustainable design, engineering, and environmental remediation projects. In my work with them, I mostly have been working within cybersecurity and digital innovation for our environmental applications. In addition, I am OSHA field certified so I have conducted field measurements using a variety of sensors and measurement tools.  I have tested a range of IoT emerging technology to be used in environmental remediation sites. I have also been working on developing digital twins' data solutions for large-scale projects with 100+ sensors and field events to better map and understand large datasets. For the cybersecurity efforts, I have helped retrofit systems with up-to-date cybersecurity protocols and equipment.  </p>

									<h2>Awards & Additional Experiences</h2>
									<ul class ="alt">
										<li><b><a href="https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/louis-stokes-alliances-minority-participation"> Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP)</a> Research Scholar</b> awarded May 2023: I was funded by the LSAMP program during May 2022-August 2022 to conduct full time research at Cornell. I worked in Matthew Reid's lab working on the digital innovation for our woodchip bioreactor automation project.</li>
										<li><b><a href="https://www.src.org/">Semiconductor Research Corporation</a> Scholar</b> awarded August 2022: I was awarded this funding from Intel, IBM and Texas Instruments to sponsor my research during the school-year from 2022 to 2023.</li>
										<li><b>DOE Grant <a href ="pdfs/Amendment_2_DE-FOA-0002475_Final.pdf">DE-FOA-0002475</a> (on behalf of RMS)</b> awarded October 2022: I wrote, applied and successfully won a $4 million DOE Electric Vehicle grant with Stanford's National Energy Lab for RMS Energy Consulting (when I was working as a technical specialist). I proposed a solution that utilized SLAC's smart charging infrastructure planning tool to be in a living-lab study with Southern California Edison (SCE) that trains engineers how to utilize the tool to optimize and expand SCE's charging infrastructure.  </li>
										<li><b>Presented at Cornell Institute for Digital Technology's Symposium </b> in October 2022: I presented a scientific poster and a short talk about my contributions to the automated bioreactor research</li>
										<li><b>First Undergraduate to speak at NASA & ESIP's Ignite at AGU Talk</b> in December 2022: I presented a 5-minute ignite format talk where I utilized my bioreactor research as a metaphor for how we need to increase support and actively uplift underrepresented minorities in engineering. I also shared my own experience of being a bi-racial queer latina in the electrical and environmental engineering spheres. </li>
